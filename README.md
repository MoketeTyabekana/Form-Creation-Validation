Form Creation and Validation
This project demonstrates how to create a user registration form with basic HTML structure, apply styles using CSS, and implement client-side validation using JavaScript. The form allows users to input a username, email, and password, and it validates the inputs according to specific criteria before submission.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to ensure that users provide valid data when registering via the form. The form includes three fields:

Username
Email
Password
Upon form submission, validation is performed using JavaScript to verify the correctness of the inputs. If all validations pass, a success message is displayed. Otherwise, appropriate error messages are shown.

Features
Username Validation: Ensures the username is at least 3 characters long.
Email Validation: Verifies that the email input contains both an '@' and a '.'.
Password Validation: Checks that the password is at least 8 characters long.
Real-time Feedback: Provides immediate feedback for users by displaying validation errors or success messages.
Form Styling: The form is styled with modern, user-friendly design using CSS.
File Structure
The project consists of three main files:

index.html: Contains the structure of the user registration form.
style.css: Styles the form to ensure a clean and responsive design.
script.js: Implements form validation logic to handle user input and display feedback.
